My Github hello world tutorial

My name is Chris. I am interested in learning more about web and application development. I am a complete beginner and am trying to learn what I can while juggling work, family, and life in general. If anyone actually reads this, anything that you would be willing to throw my way or point me in the direction of would be greatly appreciated. Thanks! 😁
